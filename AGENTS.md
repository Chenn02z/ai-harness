# AGENTS.md

Operating instructions for Codex in this repo. This file is the minimum
orientation contract: it tells the main agent what must be true on every run,
not which docs to read next.

## Startup

**Applies to every Codex session, not repeated per skill invocation.**

- Read `README.md` once for workspace overview.
- The active `SKILL.md` declares its own document prerequisites. Do not
  preemptively read canonical docs that the skill does not require.
- When a skill requires orientation beyond its own prerequisites, it will
  name the files explicitly.
- Do not re-read `docs/PRODUCT.md`, `docs/CONTEXT.md`, `docs/WORKFLOWS.md`, or
  `docs/AGENT_ROLES.md` unless the active skill names them.

Use detailed reference docs when needed:

- `docs/WORKFLOWS.md` for handoff interface contracts and status language.
- `docs/AGENT_ROLES.md` for project subagent roles and ownership rules.
- `docs/DOCS_POLICY.md` for documentation destinations and status rules.

## Project

This repo is a specs-driven AI harness for indie developers. It exists to make
agentic development durable through:

- requirements gathering
- milestone and spec authoring
- role-specific subagents
- verification and review gates
- reusable workflow skills
- explicit handoffs and traceability

The harness is intentionally generic. Product-specific domains must be added
through your own specs and docs, not assumed globally.

## Core Rule

Specs define truth. Skills define process. Agents execute roles. Model choices
are capacity decisions.

**The main agent delegates work; it does not perform subagent work itself.**
During a dev loop: do not read source files when `explorer` exists for that,
do not edit files when `implementer` exists for that, and do not run
verification commands when `test-runner` exists for that. The main agent owns
judgment, delegation, reconciliation, reporting, and user interaction only.

Any non-trivial work should produce a trace via `$codex-agent-tracer` under
`.agent-trace/<workflow-id>/`. The full routing trace includes:

1. Gather requirements.
2. Draft or update an Accepted milestone when the work is milestone-sized.
3. Create or update a spec from an Accepted milestone.
4. Review the spec for ambiguity and failure modes.
5. Mark the spec Accepted before implementation.
6. Implement only what the spec requires.
7. Verify against the spec.
8. Update docs and context when decisions settle.

Small local documentation or cleanup tasks may skip a formal spec only when the
user explicitly allows it or the change is obviously reversible.

## Main Skills

When the user invokes a project workflow skill, that invocation explicitly
authorizes the main agent to use the project subagents named by that skill's
workflow.

**Delegation is mandatory.** When a skill says to use a subagent:

- `explorer` is for reading repo state.
- `implementer` is for editing files.
- `test-runner` is for verification.

If a selected skill says to use a subagent, the main agent must either:

1. invoke that subagent,
2. report that the subagent tool is unavailable, or
3. explicitly explain why the subagent is not applicable before proceeding.

Silent manual substitution for a required subagent is a workflow violation.

All project workflow skills may produce a `.agent-trace/` folder. The trace is
the canonical evidence log backing the handoff artifact.

- `$requirements`: gather requirements and produce Accepted milestones.
- `$spec`: turn Accepted milestones into formal specs.
- `$dev-loop`: implement from an Accepted spec through verification.
- `$context`: keep AGENTS, docs, specs, skills, and agents aligned.
- `$test`: run targeted verification against a spec.
- `$grill-with-docs`: adversarial review for ambiguity, scope creep, and weak
  contracts.

If a skill emits a handoff, preserve it for the next workflow. Do not rely on
conversational memory.

## Project Agents

Project agents live in `.codex/agents/`.

Read-only agents:

- `spec-planner`
- `spec-griller`
- `explorer`
- `reviewer`

Write-capable agents:

- `implementer`
- `test-runner`
- `doc-curator`

Only `implementer`, `test-runner`, and `doc-curator` should edit files, and
only when the active workflow calls for it.

The main agent owns judgment, reconciliation, user interaction, and final
reporting.

## Repository Rules + Delegation

- Keep changes surgical and tied to the current spec or explicit task.
- Prefer repo docs over general assumptions.
- Do not expand scope during implementation without updating the spec first.
- Keep model/provider choices in agent config or explicit specs.
- Do not make bash the orchestration brain.
- Never hardcode secrets, tokens, or keys.
- Preserve user-owned worktree changes.
- Do not revert unrelated edits.
- Do not read source files when `explorer` is available and delegated.
- Do not edit files when `implementer` is available and delegated.
- Do not run verification commands when `test-runner` is available and delegated.
- Batch reviewer findings: one implementer pass per review cycle, not a
  fix-verify-fix-verify ping-pong.

## Commands

Document project-specific setup and verification commands in this file once the
repo has them. Until then, report missing commands as a repo maturity gap.

## Definition Of Done

A task is done when:

1. The change satisfies the relevant spec or explicit task.
2. The diff is scoped to the requested behavior.
3. Verification was run, or the missing command/reason is reported.
4. Docs/spec status are updated when a decision settles.
5. Remaining risks or follow-up specs are named plainly.
